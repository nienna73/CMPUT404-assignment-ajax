Changes Made
============
The drawing page can be used my multiple simultaneous users, the drawing pen colour can be changed, the background colour can toggle between black and white, and users have the option to clear the board. The way drawings are assigned names was also changed so as to reduce the likelihood of your drawing erasing another user's drawing due to them both having the same name. Happy drawing!
